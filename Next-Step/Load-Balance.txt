Load Balancing Algorithms Developers Should Know.

Effective load balancing is crucial in system design, providing high availability and optimizing resource utilization.

Let's look at how some of the most popular load balancing algorithms work.

🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗔𝗹𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗺𝘀

𝟭) 𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗻

It distributes requests sequentially between servers, ensuring equitable distribution.

Despite its simplicity, it does not account for server load, which might be a drawback when demand changes significantly.

𝟮) 𝗥𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗺

Implements a simple way of distributing requests regardless of server load or capability.

This form of load distribution is basic, less precise, and suitable for less complicated applications.

𝟯) 𝗜𝗣 𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗵

Uses a consistent hashing method depending on the client's IP address to route requests.

This technique is one way to ensure session persistence by consistently directing requests from the same client to the same server.

𝟰) 𝗪𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗻

Improves round robin by assigning requests based on server capacity, aiming to better utilize resources by allocating more requests to higher-capacity servers.

This approach seeks to optimize resource use, though actual results can vary with request complexity and system conditions.

🔹 𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗔𝗹𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗺𝘀

𝟱) 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀

Intelligently sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections, adapting to changing loads.

This technique aims to better reflect current server utilization, potentially leading to more efficient resource consumption.

𝟲) 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲

Targets performance by routing requests to the server with the quickest response time.

By considering both current server load and performance, this technique supports faster processing, potentially reducing response times for users.

While these are some of the most popular load-balancing strategies, there are other algorithms that also address specific needs and challenges. Choosing the right algorithm is very important to ensuring your application remains scalable, reliable, and efficient.
