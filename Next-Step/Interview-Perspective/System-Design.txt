This 60-second Post Will Save You at least 15 Hours of Reading on System Design Interviews

Here’s how a typical system design interview happens (from a real conversation)

 1. Handling Millions of Requests per Second 

Interviewer: “Your system needs to handle millions of requests per second. What’s your approach?” 

You: I’ll start with a load balancer to evenly distribute traffic across multiple application servers and I will also use a Reverse Proxy like NGINX or AWS ALB for added routing intelligence. 


 2. Server Failures and High Availability 

Interviewer: “What happens if a server goes down?” 

You: I’d replicate data across multiple servers and set up a heartbeat mechanism to detect failures. Failed servers are replaced using auto-scaling in cloud services. 


 3. Scaling for Traffic Spikes 

Interviewer: “What if traffic spikes overnight?” 

You: Horizontal scaling, I’d add more servers dynamically behind the load balancer using auto-scaling groups or Kubernetes clusters. 

I will also use caching layers like Redis or Memcached to reduce backend load. 

 4. Storing Large Volumes of Data 

Interviewer: “How would you store terabytes or petabytes of data?” 

You: I’d shard the database and distribute data across multiple nodes using techniques like consistent hashing to avoid data imbalance. 

 5. Ensuring Data Durability 

Interviewer: “How do you ensure no data is lost?” 

You: Replication, I’d keep multiple copies of data using a Primary-Replica setup or a Leaderless Replication model. For mission-critical systems, multi-region replication ensures disaster recovery. 


 6. Dealing with Write Performance Issues 

Interviewer: “Won’t replication slow down writes?” 

You: It depends on whether we prioritize strong consistency or eventual consistency. 
- For strong consistency, wait until writes propagate to all replicas before returning success. 
- For high write throughput, go with eventual consistency like DynamoDB or Cassandra. 

 7. Conflict Resolution in Distributed Systems 

Interviewer: “How do you handle conflicting writes in distributed databases?” 

You: Use techniques like vector clocks or timestamps to track versions of data. Conflicts can be resolved during reads using application logic. 

 8. Write-Heavy Use Cases
Interviewer: “When would you use leaderless replication?” 

You: Leaderless systems like Cassandra are great for high-write use cases, where speed matters more than consistency—e.g., logging systems or IoT data collection. 


Interviewer: How would you optimize the performance of the web application ?

1. Minimize HTTP requests by bundling and minifying assets (CSS, JS).

5. Compress and optimize images to reduce file size without losing quality.
 
6. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.

7. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets from geographically distributed servers.

8. Minimize the use of blocking JavaScript and prioritize asynchronous operations.
